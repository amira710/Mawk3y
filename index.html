        >is a telemedicine application designed to make healthcare more
        accessible and organized. <br />It allows patients to connect with
        doctors online for chronic diseases that can be treated from home, or
        book offline visits for in-clinic treatments. <br />

        The app also provides a complete medical record for each patient, so all
        visits, prescriptions, and test results are stored in one place. <br />
        In addition, HealNet supports healthcare authorities with tools to
        monitor new diseases and public health trends.</i
